# Project(Unit1) - Study Buddy (PDF Quizzer)

Study Buddy (PDF Quizzer) is a simple NLP application that allows users to ask questions from a PDF document and receive answers extracted directly from the document using Hugging Face’s extractive Question Answering pipeline.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- DistilBERT (Question Answering)  
- PyPDF2  

## Description
The system reads a PDF, processes its text, and answers user questions by extracting relevant information. If the answer is not explicitly present, the system reports that it is not found.

## Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates extractive question answering using pre-trained models and highlights the importance of document structure in NLP tasks.
